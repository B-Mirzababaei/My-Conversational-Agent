when a person's understanding ponders over the existence of God it encounters nothing but contradictions,1
natural (non-supernatural) theories adequately explain the development of religion and belief in gods,1

"atheism is evidence of a healthy, independent mind",1
the God hypothesis inferior to evolution by natural selection as explanations for the complexity of life,1
"where design fails to explain complexity, evolution by natural selection succeeds",1
"The theory of natural selection is much simpler than the theory of the existence of such a complex being, and thus preferable",1
God is improbable,1
a creator of a universe with such complexity would have to be complex and improbable,1
"there must be a first cause, which can be given the name God",1
evolution can explain the apparent design in nature,1
"Natural selection and similar scientific theories are superior to a ""God hypothesis""—the illusion of intelligent design—in explaining the living world and the cosmos",1
"atheism is evidence of a healthy, independent mind",1
evolution by natural selection can explain apparent design in nature,1
the designer hypothesis immediately raises the larger problem of who designed the designer,1

"fills a ""much needed gap",1
religion is socially dangerous,1

"everything in the Universe has a purpose, which must have been caused by God",1
"everything in the Universe follows laws, which must have been created by God",1
God must exist to give force to moral obligations,1
"objective moral truths and the binding nature of obligations suggests a high power to enforce them, regarded as God",1
only the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived could support the existence of moral order in the world,1
"A natural moral order requires the existence of God as orthodoxly conceived, so god must exist",1
there is not good argument for God's existence that arises from pure reason alone,1
all moral thought requires the assumption that God exists,1

"identification requirements, however, may heighten the opportunities for confusion and voter intimidation",1
may reduce rather than expand the electorate,1
voter identification laws that could suppress the turnout by voters,1
presenting them is a minor inconvenience when weighed against the possibility of ineligible voters affecting elections,1
photo ID requirements disproportionately affect minority and elderly voters,1
photo identification was necessary to prevent widespread voter fraud,1
would decrease voting,1

procedures for acquiring an ID were too burdensome and costly for some low income or elderly voters,1
conscription would not provide adequate protection for the rights of conscientious objectors,1

the draft is fundamentally unfair,1
The draft has been perceived by some as unfairly targeting the poor and lower middle classes,1

the draft should be reinstated to make the military more equal,1
"the draft ""does bring people from all quarters of our society together in the common purpose of serving",1
it violates individual rights,1
represents slavery and involuntary servitude,1
"Of all the statist violations of individual rights in a mixed economy, the military draft is the worst",1
It is an abrogation of rights,1
It negates man’s fundamental right—the right to life,1
the very conception of a just government in its duty to the citizen includes the reciprocal obligation of the citizen to render military service in case of need,1
"in a cost-to-benefit ratio, conscription during peace time is not worthwhile",1
Months or years of service amongst the most fit and capable subtracts from the productivity of the economy,1
The work effort of the conscripts is effectively wasted,1
professionally-skilled conscripts are also difficult to replace in the civilian workforce,1
"Every soldier conscripted in the army is taken away from his civilian work, and away from contributing to the economy which funds the military",1
it was the right and privilege of every citizen to participate to the defense of the whole society,1
mandatory military and national service as ways of instilling maturity in young adults,1
"some service is better than none at all, bringing citizens in contact with their military",1
the abolition of the draft would lead to recruitment shortages even for higher ranking positions,1
considerable savings in defence spending from abolishing the draft,1
professional armed forces can be more expensive than a draft-based military,1
the draft was simply anachronistic,1
The draft obliged male citizens to pay society back through their military or civilian service,1
military service provides job skills,1
personal and technical skills learned in the military will improve later employment prospects in civilian life,1
leadership skills acquired during military training can absolutely enhance one’s chances for success in corporate life,1
in the case of a mandatory draft members of the U.S. Congress would be much less likely to authorize an unnecessary war,1
bringing back the draft would remedy the social disparity,1
a draft would make the military more representative of the American public at large,1

government-to-government aid was neither necessary nor sufficient for development,1
leads to corruption,1
misallocates resources,1
erodes civil society,1
Countries which rely on only a few exports for much of their income are very vulnerable to changes in the market value of those commodities,1
Aid helps make the recipient country (the country that receives aid) get more developed,1
Often aid does not even reach the poorest people,1
"Often money gained from aid is used up to make infrastructures (bridges, roads etc.), which only the rich can use",1
the recipient country becomes more dependent on aid from a donor country,1
aid is ineffective,1
development aid has no effect on the speed with which countries develop,1
much government-to-government aid was ineffective,1
help based on direct donation creates dependency and corruption,1
has an adverse effect on local production,1
rich countries have put so many conditions on aid that it has reduced aid effectiveness,1
a very large part of the spend money on development aid is simply wasted uselessly,1
Development Assistance to the Third World Has Failed,1
development aid is an important source of investment for poor and often insecure societies,1
aid's complexity and the ever expanding budgets leave it vulnerable to corruption,1
Aid to underdeveloped countries has sometimes been criticized as being more in the interest of the donor than the recipient,1
it is not effective,1
it did not do what it was intended to do or help the people it was intended to help,1
foreign aid generally does boost growth,1
"foreign assistance, especially foreign capitalism, has been somewhat deleterious to African development",1
aid can often distort incentives in poor countries in various harmful ways,1
"An implementation of aid can easily be problematic, causing more problems than it solves",1
foreign aid causes harm to the recipient nations,1
hollows out the local economy,1
"encouraging developing economies to develop their agriculture with a focus on exports is not effective on a global market where key players, such as the US and EU, heavily subsidise their products",1
aid is not targeting the most extreme poverty,1
it neither goes where it was intended nor helps those intended,1
Aid can make progress towards reducing poverty worldwide,1
foreign aid is efficacious,1
"in many instances, aid is conditionally tied due to political motives, rather than notions of proper policy and implementation",1
direct monetary assistance from industrialized countries has gone to increase the standard of living in many impoverished nations,1
intervention by financial contributors could ease domestic unrest,1
The contribution of funding to economically unstable nations has helped to create more economic opportunities,1
some aid has been proven to help nations develop in the past,1
"When a country is given money because they cannot financially sustain themselves, several negative effects have the potential to develop",1
it simply does not work,1
"In the case of federally funded aid, contributions have, in effect, crowded out any investment in the private sectors of many nations",1
pouring vast amounts of money into development aid without any concern for results has failed,1
Trade is a key factor in economic development,1
A successful use of trade can boost a country's development,1
opening up markets to international trade may leave local producers swamped by more competitive foreign producers,1
"trade, development, and poverty reduction are intimately linked",1
trade and growth are strongly linked,1
export-led growth has been a key part of many countries’ successful development strategies,1
liberalization when institutions and the economy are not strong enough to face risks and opportunities can be harmful,1
trade-led growth is pro-poor,1
foreign aid to many third world countries has failed to produce sustainable growth,1
people continue to die at a high rate due in large part to lack of sufficient aid,1
sufficient foreign aid can make up for the lack of capital in poor countries,1
"If the foreign assistance is substantial enough, and lasts long enough, the capital stock rises sufficiently to lift households above subsistence",1
helps growth,1
is essential in providing better lives,1
trade rules are often unfair as they block access to richer nations’ markets and ban poorer nations from supporting their industries,1
Western monetary aid often only serves to increase poverty and social inequality,1
foreign aid is seen to be serving the interests of the donor more than the recipient,1
some of the foreign aid is stolen by corrupt governments and officials,1
higher aid levels erode the quality of governance,1
aid is not spread properly,1
free trade will make society more prosperous,1
"Trade also allows for better quality produce and competitiveness between nations, effectively raising the living standards of those nations",1
increased trade is the best way to relieve extreme poverty throughout the world,1
free trade gives optimal economic advantages,1
Free trade is generally considered to achieve an overall increase in utility in a society,1
Individuals can be made worse off by an opening of trade,1
aid towards Africa does more harm than good,1
foreign aid may not even be helpful in the long run to many African nations,1
free trade helps workers in developing countries,1
Care work is essential to human well-being,1
care work is directly related to the health of a society as well as to the economic development of that society,1
"the household sector is a wealth spender, and not a wealth creator",1
the household sector plays a very important role in wealth creation,1
women's jobs in the home were not part of any market,1
the household does not form wealth,1
the quality of care may decrease in response to the call for profit-making and efficiency,1
care work should not be done for pay because pay will undermine the intrinsic motivations for this work,1
care work should be better compensated by the market,1
care work as central to economic development and human well-being,1
unpaid domestic work is just as valuable as paid work,1
domestic labor is work,1
intellectual property is desirable because it encourages innovation,1
creators will not have sufficient incentive to invent unless they are legally entitled to capture the full social value of their inventions,1
intellectual property rights are essential to maintaining economic growth,1
give statutory expression to the moral and economic rights of creators in their creations,1
"promote, as a deliberate act of Government policy, creativity",1
encourage fair trading which would contribute to economic and social development,1
effective enforcement of intellectual property rights is critical to sustaining economic growth,1
a positive correlation between the strengthening of the IP system and subsequent economic growth,1
IP can be a disincentive to innovation,1
they promote public welfare,1
To violate intellectual property is therefore no different morally than violating other property rights,1
allowing property rights in ideas and information creates artificial scarcity,1
infringes on the right to own tangible property,1
patents were obstructing research,1
patents as state-granted monopolies inconsistent with free trade,1
they may hinder innovation,1
"give rise to ""troll"" entities",1
"intellectual property rights may become so fragmented that, effectively, no one can take advantage of them",1
Patents and copyrights are the legal implementation of the base of all property rights: a man's right to the product of his mind,1
intellectual property laws can actually hinder innovation,1
they divert resources from research and development to patent filing and lawsuits,1
are not a legitimate subject of property rights,1
the only way that intellectual property rights can be implemented is by limiting others' physical property rights,1
"prohibiting people from using, reproducing, and trading copyrighted material is an infringement of freedom of speech",1
one cannot own information without owning other people,1
the patent monopoly..consists in protecting inventors..against competition for a period long enough to extort from the people a reward enormously in excess of the labor measure of their services,1
have hindered the ability of consumers to buy the products they want,1
copyright law protects corporate interests while criminalizing legitimate use,1
the law is fair and just,1
patent and copyright laws support in fundamental and thoroughgoing ways the expansion of the range of creative human activities that can be commodified,1
granting developers temporary monopolies over their works encourages further development and creativity,1
copyright has never been of net benefit to society,1
serves to enrich a few at the expense of creativity,1
"copyright is invalid because, unlike physical property, intellectual property is not scarce",1
is obsolete,1
the cost of trying to enforce it is unreasonable,1
"knowledge should be ""shared in solidarity",1
copyright law as preventing or slowing human progress,1
"without an intellectual property rights regime, authors would have no incentive to further create",1
artists cannot produce new works without an economic incentive,1
copyright drives the economy by compelling creativity,1
is a fundamental right for both creators and consumers,1
all proposed alternatives to copyright protection do not allow for viable business models,1
content creators would not have incentive to produce their products if they cannot be guaranteed payment,1
intellectual property as a necessary way of incentivising the creation of new creative works,1
"in the absence of intellectual property protections such as copyright and patents, various types of intangible assets would be under-produced",1
"copyright remains the fundamental way by which authors, sculptors, artists, musicians and others can fund the creation of new works",1
"without a significant period of legal protection of their future income, many valuable books and artworks would not be created",1
"Without a feasible way to recoup investments of creative time through copyright, there would be little economic incentive to produce",1
it has been largely successful in financing the creation and distribution of a wide variety of works,1
the very concept of copyright has never benefited society,1
has always served simply to enrich a few at the expense of creativity,1
the current (international) copyright system undermines its own goal,1
quality works can be created even in the absence of a copyright-enforced monopoly rent,1
Copyright can also be used to stifle political criticism,1
has made and continues to make a valuable even essential contribution to the creation and dissemination of works,1
Patents provide incentives for economically efficient research and development,1
patents facilitate and encourage disclosure of innovations into the public domain for the common good,1
"If inventors did not have the legal protection of patents, in many cases, they would prefer or tend to keep their inventions secret",1
Awarding patents generally makes the details of new technology publicly available,1
"when a patent's term has expired, the public record ensures that the patentee's idea is not lost to humanity",1
patents have been criticized as inconsistent with free trade,1
property rights encourage their holders to develop the property,1
property rights encourage their holders to develop their property or generate wealth,1
interference by the state over the centuries in property ownership has had dire consequences for justice as well as for economic productivity,1
all information should be freely distributed and unrestricted,1

Biodiversity is also important to the security of resources,1
biodiversity has intrinsic aesthetic and spiritual value to mankind,1
Biodiversity supports many ecosystem services,1
Biodiversity is directly involved in water purification,1
Loss of biodiversity results in the loss of natural capital that supplies ecosystem goods and services,1
"As long as species have been evolving, species have been going extinct",1
the loss of native species as a loss to ecotourism,1
People who live close to nature can be dependent on the survival of all the species in their environment,1
The very fact that a species is near extinction implies that its final demise will have negligible impact,1
"since species become extinct ""all the time"" the disappearance of a few more will not destroy the ecosystem",1
is an integral part of the development process,1
there is a threat of significant reduction or loss of biological diversity,1

all species have inherent value,1
each organism has a purpose and a reason for being,1
"They warrant our respect, whether or not they are of immediate benefit to us",1
we have a responsibility to act as custodians for nature,1
More biologically diverse communities appear to be more productive,1
they appear to be more stable,1
there are direct economic consequences of losing diversity in certain ecosystems and in the world as a whole,1
diverse ecosystems actually resist invasion and disease better than their less diverse equivalents,1
the indirect effects of losing many species as well as the diversity of ecosystems in general are enormous,1

gun ownership is a civil liberty,1
citizens need to arm themselves to safeguard political liberties against threats by the government,1
the personal right to bear arms to be a paramount right by which other rights could be protected,1
the likelihood that a death will result is significantly increased when either the victim or the attacker has a firearm,1
criminal use of guns is far more common than self-defense use of guns,1
more guns can reduce crime,1
limiting access to guns by law-abiding people makes them more vulnerable to armed criminals,1

guns provide some level of protection against criminality and tyranny,1
widespread gun ownership is protection against tyranny,1
most guns are in the hands of people who are unlikely to misuse them,1
the right to bear arms is absolute and unqualified,1

Defensive use of guns is both common and effective in preventing injury and property loss,1
gun bans would increase injuries and deaths,1
Bribery in bureaucracy has been viewed as a reason for higher cost of production of goods and services,1
Expectations of when a monetary transaction is appropriate can differ from place to place,1
it encourages rent seeking behaviour,1
the bribery of government officials impedes the democratic process,1
may interfere with good government,1

"since the transition to new government in August 2011, Burma's human rights record has been improving",1
the American-led sanctions have had adverse effects on the civilian population,1
economic sanctions and political pressure by Western countries on Burma was counter-productive and futile,1
economic sanctions and political pressure on the Burmese military regime remain the only feasible policy to achieve a restoration of democracy and human rights in Burma,1

poll results (whether accurate or inaccurate) can significantly influence election results in closely contested elections,1
"as poll results are repeatedly reported, the bandwagon effect will tend to snowball and become a powerful aid to leading candidates",1
"predictions about public opinion become fact as mass media's coverage of the majority opinion becomes the status quo, and the minority becomes less likely to speak out",1
Exit polls have historically and throughout the world been used as a check against and rough indicator of the degree of election fraud,1

"the purpose of the restrictions in import of goods into Gaza are to pressure Hamas, which does not recognise Israel and backs attacks on its citizens",1
The stated purpose of the blockade was to pressure Hamas into ending the rocket attacks,1
it is not legally responsible for Gaza and not obliged to help a hostile territory beyond whatever is necessary to avoid a humanitarian crisis,1
the importation curbs are in place to pressure Hamas,1
A country has the right to decide that it chooses not to engage in economic relations or to give economic assistance to the other party to the conflict,1

school choice programs would allow these students to opt out of bad schools and acquire a better education,1
freedom of education notably implies the freedom for parents to choose a school for their children without discrimination on the basis of finances,1
vouchers could result in nothing more than a cash-handout for many middle-class and wealthy families already sending their kids to private schools,1
"Through free competition between vendors for the provision of products and services, prices tend to decrease, and quality tends to increase",1
a voucher system for public education would make public schools compete with one another thus making them more accountable and efficient,1

public education would be destroyed by tuition vouchers,1
the tuition voucher proposal would undermine public education,1
they would undermine public schools,1
they would undermine public schools,1

no family should be forced to send kids to a school they know is failing,1
"by distributing vouchers to the families of students equal to the tuition that he/she would receive at his/her local public school, a student’s family could then choose from options where best to send their child",1
access to resources play a hugely important role in educational inequality,1
the educational system forces low-income families to place their children into less-than-ideal school systems,1

significant support among college football fans for a playoff to replace the BCS,1

poverty is one of the causes of criminal activity as a means of survival,1
A proportion of crime is said to be the result of society offering only demeaning work with little sense of creativity,1
lack of integration between what the culture calls for and what the structure permits that causes deviant behaviour,1
The poor would commit crime out of need or out of a sense of injustice,1
external factors are not at play when it comes to crime,1
crime is solely the failure of a rational choice decision,1
people have free will to choose how to act,1
crime rates are associated with poverty,1
may cause neighborhoods to be isolated from the mainstream of society and become prone to violence,1
"if the social structure of opportunities is unequal and prevents the majority from realizing the dream, some of them will turn to illegitimate means (crime) in order to realize it",1
delinquency can result from differential opportunity for lower class youth,1
those from wealthier backgrounds have considerably more access to legitimate means than do those who are economically disadvantaged,1
Criminality becomes attractive when expectations of being able to fulfil goals (therefore achieving success) by legitimate means cannot be fulfilled,1
delinquent rates are highest in areas with economic decline,1
Social disorganisation may also produce crime by isolating communities from the mainstream culture,1
"causes of crime lie within the individual offender, rather than in their external environment",1
crime is caused by the difficulty those in poverty have in achieving socially valued goals by legitimate means,1
"if all an individual's needs are met, there is no point in criminal activity",1

"in a competitive society in which there is an inequality in the distribution of goods, those groups with limited or restricted access to goods will be more likely to turn to crime",1
"In those segments of the population which experience the greatest relative deprivation, therefore, there is readiness to turn to crime to overcome inequality and eliminate relative deprivation",1
crime is most commonly perpetrated by individuals who lack strong bonds or connections with their social environment,1
